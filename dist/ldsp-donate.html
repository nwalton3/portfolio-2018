It also had some UI items that needed to be updated, like very slow animations. We wanted to make the donation experience as smooth and friendly as possible.</p></section><section class="top"><h2>Users <span class="slash">/</span> Constraints</h2><p>We have a pretty big demographic range of users for the site, but the users we decided to focus on were women, ages 45 and older&mdash;which make up a large proportion of our donors. Some of them don't spend much time on computers and can be intimidated by complicated interfaces. They also tend to user older technology as a whole than, say, an average internet user.</p></section><section class="top"><h2>Team <span class="slash">/</span> Roles</h2><p>There were three people on the internal web team: one UX/UI designer (me), one web content specialist, and one product manager. We also worked closely with an off-site development team.</p><h3>My responsibilities</h3><ul><li>Contribute to initial needs analysis</li><li>Analyze performance</li><li>Analyze technical needs</li><li>Research best prectices in design and development for web forms</li><li>Design standard elements </li><li>Design interface</li><li>Write interface labels, text, and errors</li><li>Develop production-ready front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Test interface prototypes with users</li><li>Assist back-end team implementing new system in Adobe Experience Manager</li></ul></section><section class="top"><h2>Guiding Principles</h2><p>Based on the frequent use of older technology and the nature of many of the errors we saw with the previous form, I determined that the page should be as &ldquo;bulletproof&rdquo; as possible. That meant, in true progressive enhancement fashion, that it should use only standard form elements, and function even without javascript (it's just a form, after all). I decided to make liberal use of progressive disclosure (when javascript <em>was</em> enabled) to keep the form from becoming overwhelming. It also needed lots of inline error-checking to catch as many mistakes as possible in a friendly, intuitive way before sending the form back to the server. Finally, I decided to employ a lot of subtle UI animations to help users more easily keep track of what was happening on screen.</p></section><section class="top"><h2>Process</h2><section class="sub"><h3>Research</h3><p> </p></section></section><section class="top"><h2>A few of my favorite things</h2><section class="sub"><h3>Sweet animations</h3><p>I wanted to really fine-tune the interface animations, and make sure they were very consistent across the whole page. CSS animations offer more control over easing than javascript, but I needed to use both in some places. I wrote my own javascript animation engine, which weighs under 5K and mirrors the <code>cubic-bezier</code> easing control in CSS. It took quite awhile to work out the math, but I think the polish of the result was well worth the effort. I also made sure all movement and state changes on screen implemented the animation engine, so the interface has a very smooth, finished feel to it.</p></section><section class="sub"><h3>Super-easy radio buttons</h3><p> </p></section><section class="sub"><h3>A robust error system</h3><p> </p></section><section class="sub"><h3>Quick and easy search</h3><p>The previous system had used a fairly slow server call to search through the hundreds of funds available for donation. I moved it to a front-end function, with a JSON list for data (loaded asynchronously, of course). This provides an instantaneous, search-as-you-type interface. I also added some filtering options to help narrow things down.</p><div class="image full"><figure><img srcset="/img/400w/ldsp-donate-search.png 400w, /img/800w/ldsp-donate-search.png 800w, /img/1600w/ldsp-donate-search.png 1600w, /img/3200w/ldsp-donate-search.png 3200w" sizes="(max-width: 72em) 100vw, 90vw" src="/img/800w/ldsp-donate-search.png" alt="Fund search interface"/><figcaption>Fund search interface</figcaption></figure></div></section></section><section class="top"><h2>Success measures</h2></section><section class="top"><h2>Takeaways</h2></section></main><footer class="page"><div id="footer"><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></div></footer></body></html>
